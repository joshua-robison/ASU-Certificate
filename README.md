- [k-Means Clustering](#k-means-model)

### [Bayes Model](https://github.com/joshua-robison/ASU-GradSchool/blob/master/Notebooks/bayes_model.ipynb)
#### Data Used: [MNIST Image Data](https://github.com/joshua-robison/ASU-GradSchool/blob/master/Datasets/bayes_data)
This notebook explains how to analyze a dataset, visualize features, generate training parameters, and model a bayesian classifier.

### [k-Means Model](https://github.com/joshua-robison/ASU-GradSchool/blob/master/Notebooks/clustering_model.ipynb)
#### Data Used: [Data Points](https://github.com/joshua-robison/ASU-GradSchool/blob/master/Datasets/)
This notebook demonstrates how to associate random data into clusters (based on some criteria) and visualize the convergence of a solution.
