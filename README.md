- [k-Means Clustering](#k-means-model)
- [Convolutional Neural Network](#cnn-model)

### [Bayes Model](https://github.com/joshua-robison/ASU-GradSchool/blob/master/Notebooks/bayes_model.ipynb)
#### Data Used: [MNIST Image Data](https://github.com/joshua-robison/ASU-GradSchool/blob/master/Datasets/bayes_data)
This notebook explains how to analyze a dataset, visualize features, generate training parameters, and model a bayesian classifier.

### [k-Means Model](https://github.com/joshua-robison/ASU-GradSchool/blob/master/Notebooks/clustering_model.ipynb)
#### Data Used: [Data Points](https://github.com/joshua-robison/ASU-GradSchool/blob/master/Datasets/)
This notebook demonstrates how to associate random data into clusters (based on some criteria) and visualize the convergence of a solution.

### [CNN Model](https://github.com/joshua-robison/ASU-GradSchool/blob/master/Notebooks/cnn_model.ipynb)
#### Helper: [mnist.py](https://github.com/joshua-robison/ASU-GradSchool/blob/master/Notebooks/mnist.py)
#### Data Used: [MNIST Data](https://github.com/joshua-robison/ASU-GradSchool/blob/master/Datasets/cnn_data)
This notebook demonstrates how to construct a Convolutional Neural Network. Then it loads in MNIST image data, trains, tests and evaluates
on a subset of the data. For improved results, you could use more data, increase the number of epochs, and change the model structure.
This is simply an introduction and proof of concept.
